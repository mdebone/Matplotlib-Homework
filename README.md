# Matplotlib-Homework
Mice sacrificed for the greater good

Man so I forgot about this, and I appologize, it was during the dark times when I was having trouble with github and I cloned a remote repository onto my local machine,
and I had most of this done and turned in, but to get out of the hole that I was in, I had to basically redeclare a new local repository where it should have been, you know, C:/users/matt/dataclass 
rather than what I had been doing which was the main dataclass repo on my desktop. So this got lost in the shuffle and I appologize, it didn't show up as an unsubmitted assignment so I didn't pay
any  attention to it really. Anyway had to start back over but I finished this in the afternoon, which was sort of a feel good moment cause I know 6 weeks ago it would have taken me a week to complete,
so looking at it as a glass half full sort of situation. Especially because the python api homework after this has like 4 or 5 linear regressions so i know how to to place the line's equation so that it doesn't
cover any of the data points. The only thing that threw me and am happy I was able to revist was the ploting with pandas or ploting with matplotlib, it was like a lightbulb went off and I immediately got why some of my 
plots wouldn't print various things like set_xlabel and plt.xlabel wouldn't work some times to my confusion. So learned somthing from the exercise afterall.
